       <p>
        I am a motivated and detail-focused web developer with skills in HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Bootstrap. I design and
        build responsive websites and applications, ensuring they are easy to
        use and meet the needs of users. I have experience solving technical
        problems, using tools like Git for version control, and working with
        modern development tools like npm and Vite. I enjoy learning new things
        and working on projects that combine creativity with functionality. I am
        a team player who communicates clearly and works hard to deliver results
        that support both the team’s goals and users’ needs.
